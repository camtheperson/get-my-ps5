# How to install

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend downloading the LTS version (14.15.1 as of 12/12/2020).
1. Download this utility by clicking the green "Code" button [here](https://github.com/camtheperson/get-my-ps5), and then click "Download ZIP."
1. Unzip the contents by double clicking the ZIP file.
1. Next you'll need to open a CLI at the `get-my-ps5` folder:
    * Windows users: open the folder, type `cmd` in the address bar, and hit enter. [Still need help?](https://www.itechtics.com/open-command-window-folder/#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20a%20command,be%20opened%20in%20the%20folder.)
    * Mac users: right click the folder and select "New terminal at folder." (Note: [you'll likely need to set this up in your System Preferences](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-open-a-new-terminal-window-from-any-folder-shortcut/), but it will save you a lot of time)
1. Once you have the CLI open at the `get-my-ps5` folder, install the script by running:
    * `npm install`

That's it! You've successfully installed this script.
